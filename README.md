## Welcome to Chun Chung Chan's personal portfolio.

### Background
I recently graduated from University of California - San Diego with a Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
My course works range from lower division microbiology, chemistry, physics, calculus, through upper divison computation theory, 
computer graphic, probability theory, graph theory, exposure to machine learning and image processing, all to way to graduate course in animation and physic simulation. 
I have also joined the UCSD undergraduate research program. From this program, I have learnt the valuable skill of conducting research.  All of my knowledges are combined toward 
one purpose: to recreate reality in a simulated envirnoment.
